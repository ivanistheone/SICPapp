      The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas,
      are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one
      compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.  2. The second is
      bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting
      them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without
      uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.
      3.  The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany
      them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all
      its general ideas are made.

    <div class="normaltext">
      We are about to study the idea of a
      <em>computational process</em>.
      Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.
      As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called
      <em>data</em>.
      The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules
      called a
      <em>program</em>.
      People create programs to direct processes.
      In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
    </div>

    <div class="normaltext">
      A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer&#146;s idea of a
      spirit.  It cannot be seen or touched.  It is not composed of matter
      at all.  However, it is very real.  It can perform intellectual work.
      It can answer questions.  It can affect the world by disbursing money
      at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory.  The programs we
      use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer&#146;s spells.  They are
      carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric
      <em>programming languages</em>
      that prescribe the tasks we want our
      processes to perform.
    </div>

    <div class="normaltext">
      A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes
      programs precisely and accurately.  Thus, like the sorcerer&#146;s
      apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to
      anticipate the consequences of their conjuring.  Even small errors
      (usually called <em>bugs</em>
      or <em>glitches</em>) 
      in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.
    </div>

    <div class="normaltext">
      Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than
      learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently
      contained in a secure way.  Real-world programming, however,
      requires care, expertise, and wisdom.  A small bug in a computer-aided
      design program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of
      an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.
    </div>

    <div class="normaltext">
      Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so
      that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will
      perform the tasks intended.  They can visualize the behavior of their
      systems in advance.  They know how to structure programs so that
      unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and
      when problems do arise, they can <em>debug</em>
      their programs.  Well-designed
      computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear
      reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be
      constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

        <H4>Programming in JavaScript</H4>
          
        
      

    
        <div class="normaltext">
          We need an appropriate language for describing processes, and we will
          use for this purpose the programming language JavaScript.  Just as our
          everyday thoughts are usually expressed in our natural language (such
          as English, French, or Japanese), and descriptions of quantitative
          phenomena are expressed with mathematical notations, our process
          descriptions will be expressed in JavaScript. 
          
          JavaScript was developed in the early
          1990s as a programming language for controlling the behavior 
          of World Wide Web browsers through scripts that appear in web pages.
          The language was conceived by 
          
          
          Brendan Eich, originally under the name <em>Mocha</em>, which
          
          was later renamed to <em>LiveScript</em>, and finally to JavaScript.
          
          The name &#147;JavaScript&#148; is a trademark of Sun
          Microsystems. 
        </div>
      

    
        <div class="normaltext">
          Despite its inception as a language for controlling browsers, JavaScript
          
          is a general-purpose programming language. A JavaScript <em>interpreter</em>
          is a machine that carries out processes described in the JavaScript
          
          language. The first JavaScript interpreter was implemented by Eich
          
          
          at Netscape Communications Corporation, for the Netscape Navigator web 
          browser. The main features of JavaScript are inherited from the 
          
          
          Scheme and Self programming languages. Scheme is a dialect of Lisp, and
          
          was used as programming language for the original version of this book. 
          From Scheme, JavaScript inherited its most fundamental design principles 
          
          such as statically-scoped first-class 
          
          
          functions and dynamic typing, and as a result, it
          was fairly straightforward to translate the programs in this book
          from Scheme to JavaScript.
        </div>
      

    
        <div class="normaltext">
          JavaScript bears only superficial resemblance to the language Java, 
          
          after which it was
          
          (eventually) named; both Java and JavaScript use the block structure of the language
          
          C. In contrast with Java and C, which employ compilation to lower-level
          languages, JavaScript programs are usually interpreted by web browsers.
          
          After Netscape Navigator, other web browsers provided interpreters
          
          
          for the language, including Microsoft&#146;s Internet Explorer, whose
          JavaScript version is called
          
          <em>JScript</em>. The popularity of JavaScript for controlling web
          browsers gave rise to a standardization effort, culminating in 
          a standardized version of the language, called <em>ECMAScript</em>. The
          first edition of the ECMAScript standard was led by Guy Lewis 
          Steele Jr.&nbsp;and completed in June 1997 (Ecma 1997).
          The third edition, which is used in this book, was led by 
          Mike Cowlishaw and completed in December 1999.
        </div>
      

    
        <div class="normaltext">
          The practice of embedding JavaScript programs in web pages encouraged
          the developers of web browsers to implement JavaScript interpreters.
          As these programs became more complex,
          the interpreters became more efficient in executing them, eventually
          using sophisticated implementation techniques such as Just-In-Time
          (JIT) compilation.
          The majority of JavaScript programs (as of 2013) is embedded in 
          web pages and interpreted by browsers, but JavaScript is also used
          for scripting dashboard widgets in Apple computers running the OS X 
          operating system, for controlling software systems such as Adobe
          Reader and Adobe Flash and devices such as universal remote panels.
        </div>
      

    
        <div class="normaltext"> 
          
          However, it is the ability of browsers to execute JavaScript programs
          that makes it an ideal language for an online version of a programming
          textbook. Executing programs by clicking on things on a web page comes
          naturally in JavaScriptâ€”after all that is what JavaScript was designed
          for! More fundamentally, JavaScript
          possesses features that make it an excellent medium for studying
          important programming constructs and data structures and for relating
          them to the linguistic features that support them. JavaScript&#146;s 
          
          statically-scoped first-class functions  
          provide direct and concise access to abstraction mechanisms, and
          
          
          dynamic typing removes the need for declaring the types of the data
          being manipulated by the program.
          Above and beyond these
          considerations, programming in JavaScript is great fun.
